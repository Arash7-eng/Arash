<h1>My Experience In Guru Nanak 
Dev Engineering College Ludhiana<h1></h1>


**_Today I mean on 10july2024_**

_There is my first day in this college.
 I will come in this College so many
times. But today is a very precious 
day for me and my life.I am feeling 
very uncomfortable today and also
nervas. I will come here 8:30
All students were all around separately 
distributed.Few are those who i know 
and a large amount of those who 
I don't know._

**Shabad Kirtan And Ardas**:-

Then i search were is gurudwara 
sahib and go to gurudwara sahib. 
Almost there is 9:00 then shabad 
kirtan is started. I go inside 
gurudwara sahib and pray in the 
presence of "Shri Guru Granth Sahib".
Then i sit and listen Kirtan and close 
my eyes . Then i eat kadah parsad .
Outside the gurudwara sahib there is 
very nice arrangement of lunck .
But some health issues I don't eat thats 
all and go from here .


**Attendence**

After shabad kirtan i go for attendance mark 
and go to first table bec my section is
CSA and mark attendance and the mam who sit
on this table is give me a file.Then I enter in 
the auditorium.But outside the auditorium there 
is such a nice making of rangoli i like it.

**Auditorium**

Now i will go inside the auditorium and 
my experience is very very nice .
Then all professors and principal Dr.Sehijpal singh
address us . I am feeling very nice . One sir is present
there who is studed from here and got 
a higher post and he told us his life 
faliers and told us dont spend your time in
watching reels .
Then one more sir address us and one more and so on
One sir who give us such a very very 
kind thoughts and memories which I cannot 
forgot in my life .All VIPS honoured 
with prize.
